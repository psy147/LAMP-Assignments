Sol 3. When we change HTML file to PHP extension, on double click it simply opens as a notepad file. This is because we need a host server to open a PHP file.

Sol 4. We can execute a file with PHP extension by installing and starting Apache2 server using the command, "sudo Apache2 start", and then the PHP file will work. This is because PHP files are processed by web servers using an interpreter, which executes the code.

Sol 6. PHP file does not runs even after installing XAMPP. To run it, we have to put it in a folder named "htdocs" (/opt/htdocs).
